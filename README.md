Overview
--------

    var FuzzyIOClient = require('fuzzy.io');

    var apiKey = 'API key from fuzzy.io';

    var client = new FuzzyIOClient(apiKey);

    var agentID = 'ID from fuzzy.io';

    var inputs = {temperature: 87};

    client.evaluate(agentID, inputs, function(err, outputs) {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
      } else {
        console.log("Fan speed is " + outputs.fanSpeed);
      }
    });

FuzzyIOClient
--------------

This is the main class; it's what's returned from the require().

* **FuzzyIOClient(apiKey, apiRoot)** You have to get an `apiKey` from
  http://fuzzy.io/ . Keep this secret, by the way. `serverRoot` is the root of
  the API server. It has the correct default 'https://api.fuzzy.io' but if
  you're doing some testing with a mock, it can be useful.

This is the main method you need to use:

* **evaluate(agentID, inputs, callback)** Does a single inference.
  `agentID` is on the main page for the agent on http://fuzzy.io/ .
  The `inputs` is an object, mapping input names
  to numeric values. `callback` is a function with the signature
  `function(err, outputs)`, where `outputs` is an object mapping output names to
  numeric values.

These might be useful but you normally don't need to mess with them.

* **getAgents(callback)** `userID` is the user ID, *not* the API key.
  `callback` is a function with the signature `function(err, agents)`, where
  `agents` is an array of objects with `id` and `name` properties, one for
  each agent the user has.

* **newAgent(agent, callback)** `userID` is the user ID. `agent` is an
  agent object with at least properties `inputs`, `outputs`, `rules`. `callback`
  is a function with the signature `function(err, agent)` which returns the
  fully-realized agent with all its properties like timestamps and IDs.

* **getAgent(agentID, callback)** Gets a single agent by ID. `callback` is a
  function with the signature `function(err, agent)`.

* **putAgent(agentID, agent, callback)** Updates an agent. `callback` has the
  signature `function(err, agent)` which will return the updated version.

* **start()** This is an optional class method that will initialize client-side
  agents to do connection-pooling and keep-alive.

* **stop()** An optional class method that will clean up client-side agents.
